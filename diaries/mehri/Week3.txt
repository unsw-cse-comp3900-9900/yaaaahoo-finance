This week our group worked on the proposal that was 
due at the end of the week. I was assigned with the
task to investigate the Stock and News APIs and having
the most experience with frontend development I was also
tasked with looking at the frontend technologies we should 
use for our project. 

Once that was done I checked with Anna to see where she was
at with the wireframes for the proposal. She said she was sick
so I picked up the task and worked on the wireframes and 
Systems Modules and Flow section of the proposal.
