We completed our demo this week, and it seemed to
go well. There were some small bugs we noticed (luckily 
didn't pop up during our demo), that we fixed up.
Finalised the README file and started helping out
with the report with Rachel, Anupam did not do as much
as we'd hoped for the report so spent a whole day
doing the screenshots for the system interface section.
