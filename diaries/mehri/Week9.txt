This week Rachel, Oscar and I were focused on wrapping 
up the final tasks. Anna and Anupam did not complete their
tickets and both pushed broken code to master which had to be 
reverted. We locked master branch from being able to be committed
to directly since both memebrs were not creating pull request even
after telling them to make pull requests. 

Worked on a caching mechanism to ensure that if we hit API limits
during our demo we have backup data we can fall back on in Firebase.
We combed through any final bugs left, and polished up the project.
