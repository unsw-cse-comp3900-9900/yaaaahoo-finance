This week I was assigned with figuring out how to
connect the firebase with the UI I worked on last 
week. Anna had uploaded a firebase project to the
repository. When I tried merging that code with my
UI I noticed it had some pieces missing such as 
persistence of authentication when one refreshes the 
page, a way to add extra information for a user for
our proposed recommendation system, and we also had
to ensure the home page for logged in users would be
a protected page that can only be accessed if a user
is logged in. A lot of the code was just empty
React pages, which I ignored.

I managed to find a blog that steps through how to
use firebase in a react application and notcied a 
lot of similarity with the code Anna had and the code
in the blog:

It was very helpful and I successfully maanged to 
figure out a simple sign up and log in flow. I still
needed to figure out how to provide extra information
to a user on sign up.
