Having issues with our group, two members not contributing.
Had to pick up both Anna and Anupam's tasks since they had 
not even started on their tasks on the Sunday it was due. 
I managed to get a huge bulk of the work done over the long 
weekend so we were ready to demo Ali most of our project before
the official demo. 

Adding/Removing holdings, related news, search functionality 
and company summary page were pretty much done at this point.
