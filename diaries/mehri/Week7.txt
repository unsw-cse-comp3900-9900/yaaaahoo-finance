We're falling a bit behind schedule. In our sprint
planning session this week it was emphasised we 
really need to complete the tasks we have been
assigned this week or we will be seriously behind 
and may not meet our deadlines. Everyone in the group
acknowledged the tasks they were assigned and said they
were able to complete it by our weely deadline.

After the meeting had to work on connecting the react application 
with the flask application Anna set up. The ticket tasked for setting up 
the flask application highlighted she also needed to integrate it with 
the UI, which she had not done...but she said her ticket was done. Spent 
quite some time trying to run the flask application because there was
no instructions or requirements.txt, so I had to figure it out
by trial and error. Turns out our application requires Python 3.6
for Tensorflow. I also needed to deal with CORS policy. Once
I got the flask application hooked up with the react application
I wrote README files to make it easier for the next person to run
both applications. 

I set up a demo page for sentimental analysis in the react application 
to present to Ali in the next group meeting call. I also refactored
our sign up process to be more quick and simple based on
an Econmic Times article I read on portfolio types. I captured this work
on a confluence page. It relates to the portfolio type recommendation
we want to do in our project.
