This week I wrapped up the hero page and what
we do section of the landing page, the sign up 
form, login page, and forgot password
functionality. I also figured out how to add
extra information for a user to the firebase
instance. With Ali's feedback my focus now
was to polish up those pages and refactor code.
I focused on ensuring we have an easy to follow
structure to our code that complies with React's
philosophy of breaking down the UI into a
component hierarchy.

Our group realised that most of our project is 
actually frontend and while most of the group 
preferred to do backend work most of that work 
was covered by Firebase and Oscar had wrapped 
up the machine learning models. I needed more
hands to help me with the frontend. To help
everyone out I created a Confluence page which
provided a step by step guide on how to create 
a page and contribute frontend work to the 
project. It also stepped through how to set up 
a firebase instance. Our group also realised 
we have quite a bit of limitation with the stock
API we were going to use for the project, Rachel 
has found alternatives to look into.
