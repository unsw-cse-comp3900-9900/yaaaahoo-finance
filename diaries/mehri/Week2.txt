Week 2 Summary

Friday - 28/02:
Locked down group, decided on choosing the stock portfolio 
management system as our project. Our product's target persona 
is someone who is not novice, nor an expert in finance. 
Set up a call for Sunday to start planning our project.

Sunday - 1/03:
Had a 1 hour group call to discuss what should be in our proposal,
technology stack, how we would test and peer review each others 
code, set action items til our Friday lab and defining
what our sprint cycle would look like. My task is to look at APIs
we could use for our project and wireframing.
