Week 2
Group created. Worked on potential features we wanted to add to the web application. Researched the different methods we could potentially use to make predictions. Was intended to discuss with Anupam, but he did not complete the required work.

Week 3
Created an sequential model that uses a LSTM layer, and is able to accurately make next day predictions - by myself.

Week 4 - 5
Converted my model so that it is now able to predict multiple days instead of just 1 - by myself. Predictions were far less accurate on longer predictions.

Week 6
Converted my tensorflow model into a tensorflowjs model for better compatibility with our front end technologies - by myself.
Researching potential features we could use to improve the accuracy of our model - by myself.
Did some more work on the model training and testing. Creating new features with technical analysis - by myself.
Trying different loss functions. MSE/MAE - by myself.

Week 7
Used Huggingface transformers to create a sentiment analysis model which analyses sentiments of recent Tweets - by myself.
Converted our tensorflowjs model back to a tensorflow model for the Python server which returns sentiments and predicted prices - by myself.

Week 8
Created recommendations which are based on the output of the prediction model and the sentiment analysis model - by myself.

Week 9
Created the Analysis tab UI using Chart.js for the graphs, and connected it to the Python server - working with Mehri. =

Week 10
Working on project presentation. Specifically, the Analysis tab, and showing the data persists post-logout.

Week 11
Working on project report. Specifically, the Analysis page, and reading over the report to look for issues.
