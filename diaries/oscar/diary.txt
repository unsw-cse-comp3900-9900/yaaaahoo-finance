Week 2
Group created. Worked on potential features we wanted to add to the web application. 

Week 3
Created an sequential model that uses a LSTM layer, and is able to accurately make next day predictions.

Week 4 - 5
Converted my model so that it is now able to predict multiple days instead of just 1. Predictions were far less accurate on longer predictions

Week 6
Converted my tensorflow model into a tensorflowjs model for better compatibility with our front end technologies
Researching potential features we could use to improve the accuracy of our model
Did some more work on the model training and testing. Creating new features with technical analysis
Trying different loss functions. MSE/MAE

Week 7
Used Huggingface transformers to create a sentiment analysis model which analyses sentiments of recent Tweets.
Converted our tensorflowjs model to a Python server which returns sentiments and predicted prices.

Week 8
Created recommendations which are based on the output of the prediction model and the sentiment analysis model

Week 9
Created the Analysis tab UI using Chart.js for the graphs, and connected it to the Python server

Week 10
Working on project presentation

Week 11
Working on project report
